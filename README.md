# In this project, I utilized three constraint satisfaction algorithms: Forward Checking, Backtracking Search, and Local Search (Simulated Annealing and Hill climbing search) to solve two constraint satisfaction problems: Map Coloring and Job Scheduling problems. To evaluate the efficiency of these algorithms, I measured their solution quality and the number of nodes each algorithm explored. The results showed that all three algorithms could find optimal solutions within a very short time. However, in these two constraint satisfaction problems, Forward Checking and Backtracking Search shown to be more efficient compared to Local Search. Nonetheless, it is crucial to note that the efficiency of each algorithm varies depending on the problem instance and its size.
